# challenge-01

## Description

This is the first challenge finished. I compacted the code to make it look cleaner, and changed some formatting. There was some repeated css styles so i put them under one class to make the code smaller.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
For this challenge i used HTML, and CSS in order to complete the task. it breaks down messy code into neat code for a business website keeping the same look, but making the code easier to read.
